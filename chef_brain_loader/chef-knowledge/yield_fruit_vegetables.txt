CALCULATING THE YIELD OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 


Determining Yield Percent


First, record the as-purchased quantity (APQ) from the invoice, or weigh the item before trimming or cutting.


EXAMPLE:


APQ= 5 lb (= 80 oz) carrots
Trim the item and cut as desired, saving trim and ed¬ ible portion quantity in separate containers. Weigh each separately and record their weights on a costing form:
As-Purchased Quantity (APQ) - Trim loss = Edible
Portion Quantity (EPQ)


EXAMPLE:
80 oz carrots (APQ) - 8.8 oz carrot trim = 71.2 oz
sliced carrots
Next, divide the EPQ by the APQ:
Edible Portion Q uantity = Yie(d percent
As-Purchased Quantity


EXAMPLE:
71.2 oz sliced carrots (EPQ) _ q qq 80 oz carrots (APQ)
To convert the decimal to a percent, multiply by
100: Yield percent = 89%
