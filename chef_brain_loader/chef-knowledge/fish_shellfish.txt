fish and shellfish 
identification 




Fish and shellfish were once plentiful and inexpensive; however, due to overfishing and 
the development and degradation of many coastal areas, demand has begun to outstrip 
supply. These factors have caused many countries to pass regulations limiting 
commercial fishing in specific waters, as well as the rise of aquaculture (the farm raising 
of fish), to ensure reliable sources. And as the health benefits of fish are increasingly 
becoming widely known, many Americans who traditionally favored red meats both at 
home and when they eat out are ordering fish entrees more often. 




























fish basics 




The increased value of seafood demands that a chef 
must be familiar with a wide variety of fish and shellfish, 
and their sources; be able to select absolutely fresh 
fish and shellfish of the best quality; and understand 
the best cooking method or methods to use in their 
preparation. 


The first step in the selection process is assessing 
the purveyor or market. The fishmonger should properly 
handle, ice, and display the fish and should be able to 
answer any questions regarding the fish's origin and 
its qualities: lean or oily, firm-textured or delicate, ap¬ 
propriate for moist-heat method or able to withstand a 
grill's heat. 


MARKETFORMS OF FISH 


Fish can be purchased fresh in the market forms de¬ 
scribed below, as well as in frozen, smoked, pickled, or 
salted forms. 


WHOLE FISH This is the fish as it was caught, com¬ 
pletely intact. This is typically referred to as “in 
the round." 


DRAWN FISH The viscera (guts) are removed, but 
head, fins, and scales are still intact. 


H 6 G (HEADED AND GUTTED) OR HEAD-OFF 
DRAWN The head and viscera (guts) are removed, 
but scales and fins are still intact. 


DRESSED FISH The viscera (guts), gills, scales, and 
fins are removed. The head may or may not be re¬ 
moved. Also known as pan-dressed, these fish are 
usually appropriate for a single serving. 


STEAK This is a portion-sized cross section cut 
from a dressed fish. Portion cuts from the fillets 
of large fish, such as tuna and swordfish, are also 
commonly called steaks. 


FILLET This is a boneless piece offish, removed 
from either side of the backbone. The skin may or 
may not be removed before cooking. Purveyors 
often sell fillets "pin-bone in," so it is important to 
specify "pin-bone out" when ordering. 




PAVE A portion-sized square cut from a fillet. A 
pave is generally cut from a large fillet, for exam¬ 
ple, salmon, halibut, mahi mahi, or tuna. 


FRESHNESS CHECKS FOR FINFISH 


To ensure that fish are of the best quality, the chef 
should carefully inspect them, checking for as many of 
the following signs of freshness and quality as possible: 


Fish should be received at a temperature of 
40°F/4°C or less. 


The fish should have a good overall appearance 
(clear slime, no cuts or bruising, pliable fins). 


The scales should adhere tightly to the fish. 


The flesh should respond to light pressure and not 
feel soft. 


The eyes should be clear, bright, and bulging. 


The gills should be bright pink to maroon in color, 
and if mucous is present, it should be clear. 


There should be no "belly bum"—evidence that the 
viscera (guts) were left in the fish too long, result¬ 
ing in bacteria and enzymes breaking down the 
flesh along the rib cage. 


The fish should have a clean, sweet, sea-like smell. 


STORAGE 


Under correct storage conditions, fish and shellfish can 
be held for several days without losing any appreciable 
quality. Ideally, however, the chef should purchase only 
the amount of fish needed for a day or two and should 
store it properly, as described below: 


1. Always keep fish at a proper storage temperature 
and handle them as little as possible. Finfish: 28° to 
32°F/-2° to 0°C; smoked fish: 32°F/0°C; caviar: 28° 
to 32°F/-2° to 0°C. 




2. Whole, drawn, H 6 G, and dressed fish may be rinsed 
at this point; scaling and fabricating should be de¬ 
layed until close to service time. 


3. Place the fish on a bed of shaved or flaked ice in 


a perforated container (such as a hotel pan with a 
draining pan), preferably stainless steel. The fish 




TRANCHE A portion-sized slice of a fillet that is 
cut at a 45-degree angle to expose a greater sur¬ 
face area. A tranche is generally cut from a large 
fillet, for example, salmon or halibut.

should be belly down, and the belly cavity should be 
filled with shaved ice as well. 


4. Cover with additional ice. Fish may be layered, if 
necessary, with shaved or flaked ice; cubed ice can 
bruise the fish's flesh. It also will not conform as 
closely to the fish. Shaved or flaked ice makes a 
tighter seal around the entire fish. This prevents 
undue contact with the air, slowing loss of quality 
and helping to extend safe storage life. 


5. Set the perforated container in a second container. 
In this way, as the ice melts, the water will drain 
away. If fish is allowed to sit in a pool of water, flavor 
and texture loss will occur. The longer it sits, the 
greater the loss of quality. 


6. Re-ice fish daily. Even when properly iced, fish will 
gradually lose some quality. To slow this loss, skim 


common fish types 


The skeletal structure of fish is a useful means of sepa¬ 
rating finfish into smaller groupings. The three basic 
types of finfish are flat, round, and nonbony. Flatfish 
have a backbone that runs through the center of the 
fish with two upper and two lower fillets, and both eyes 
on the same side of the head. Round fish have a middle 
backbone with one fillet on either side, and one eye on 
each side of the head. Nonbony fish have cartilage rath¬ 
er than bones. (See diagrams on pages 104 and 113.) 




the top layer of ice from the storage container, and 
replace it with fresh ice. 


Fish purchased as fillets or steaks should be stored in 
stainless- steel containers set on ice. They should not be 
in direct contact with the ice, however, because as it melts, 
much of the flavor and texture of the fish will be lost. 


Frozen fish, including ice-glazed whole fish (repeat¬ 
edly coated with water and frozen so that the ice builds 
up in layers, coating the entire fish), individually quick 
frozen (IQF), and frozen fillets (which are often treated 
with sodium tripolyphosphate [stp] to promote added 
water retention) should be stored at -20° to 0°F/-29° to 
-18°C until ready to be thawed and cooked. 


Do not accept any frozen fish with white frost on its 
edges. This indicates freezer burn, the result of improp¬ 
er packaging or thawing and refreezing of the product. 




Fish may also be categorized by their activity level: 
low, medium, or high. The more a fish swims, the darker 
its flesh will be. Darker-fleshed fish have a higher oil 
content and, therefore, a stronger flavor. When choosing 
the best cooking technique for a given fish, consider the 
oil content of the flesh. Low- and high-activity fish have 
limited cooking methods, while medium-activity fish are 
quite versatile. (See the tables on pages 106 to 113.)

shellfish 




Shellfish are aquatic animals protected by some sort 
of carapace (shell). Based on skeletal structure, they 
are segmented into four distinct categories: univalves 
(single-shelled mollusks), bivalves (mollusks with two 
shells joined by a hinge), crustaceans (jointed exterior 
skeletons or shells), and cephalopods (mollusks with 
tentacles attached directly to the head). 


MARKET FORMS 


Shellfish are available fresh and frozen in various forms. 
Fresh shellfish are available live, shucked as tails, cock¬ 
tail claws, and legs and claws. Frozen shellfish are also 
available shucked as tails, cocktail claws, and legs and 
claws. 


Shucking is the removal of a mollusk's meat from 
the shell; the shucked market form is sold as meat only, 
along with natural juices known as liquor. Mollusks 
such as oysters, clams, and mussels may be available 
shucked. Scallops are nearly always sold shucked, al¬ 
though there is a growing market for scallops that are 
live and on the half-shell with roe. 




QUALITY INDICATORS 


When purchasing live shellfish, look for signs of move¬ 
ment. Lobsters and crabs should move about. Clams, 
mussels, and oysters should be tightly closed, but as 
they age, they will begin to open, and should close when 
touched. Any shells that do not snap shut when tapped 
should be discarded; this means that the fish are dead. 
Molluskan shellfish should have a sweet, sea-like aroma. 


STORAGE 


Crabs, lobsters, and other live shellfish should be 
packed in seaweed or damp paper upon delivery. If a 
lobster tank is not available, they can be stored directly 
in their shipping containers or in perforated pans at 39° 
to 45°F/4° to 7°C until they are to be prepared. Do not 
allow lobsters or crabs to come into direct contact with 
fresh water, as it will kill them. 


Clams, mussels, and oysters purchased in the shell 
should be stored in the bag in which they were deliv¬ 
ered or in perforated pans. They should not be iced, but 
should be stored at a temperature between 35° and 
40°F/2° and 4°C. The bag should be closed tightly and 
lightly weighted to keep the shellfish from opening.
