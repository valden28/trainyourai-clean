Fruits, vegetables, and herbs have always been an important part of 






the human diet, but today consumers are more aware than ever of the 
important role these foods play in maintaining overall health and fitness 
This chapter provides professional chefs with the information they need 
to take full advantage of the abundance of fresh produce now availably 
including tips on availability, determination of quality, 
proper storage, and culinary uses. 


























general guidelines 




SELECTION 


Fruits, vegetables, and herbs should be in good condi¬ 
tion, though what constitutes a favorable appearance 
varies from one item to another. In general, fruits and 
vegetables should be free of bruises, mold, brown or 
soft spots, and pest damage; they should have colors 
and textures appropriate to their type; and any attached 
leaves should not be wilted. Fruits should be plump, not 
shriveled. Specific information on particular types of 
produce is given in the sections below. 


PRODUCTION METHODS 


Foodservice operations wield purchasing power that can 
be used to support or discourage specific agricultural 
practices. You may wish to consider several agricultural 
production and treatment methods when purchasing 
ingredients. 


Agricultural biotechnology includes a multitude of 
scientific techniques that are used to create, improve, 
or modify plants. For hundreds of years, scientists have 
improved plants for human benefit using conventional 
techniques such as selective breeding. However, con¬ 
ventional breeding methods can be time consuming and 
inaccurate. Through genetic engineering, scientists are 
now able to isolate genes for a desirable trait and trans¬ 
fer them to other organisms, resulting in genetically 
modified organisms (GMOs) that, for example, have 
higher resistance to disease. 


Irradiation is a food safety technology used to kill 
pathogenic organisms and extend shelf life. Similar to 
the pasteurization of milk and pressure processing of 
canned goods, treating foods with ionizing radiation 
(also known as cold pasteurization ) can kill bacteria that 
might otherwise cause food-borne illness. 


Sustainable agriculture pertains to agricultural pro¬ 
duction and distribution systems that focus on provid¬ 
ing a profitable farm income while promoting environ¬ 
mental stewardship. Key practices include renewing and 
protecting soil fertility and the natural resource base; 
improving the use of on-farm resources; and minimizing 
the use of nonrenewable resources. Sustainable farming 
strives to promote opportunities in family farming and 
farm communities. Sustainable practices include imple¬ 
menting systems to stem soil erosion and methods such 
as integrated pest management and field terracing. 




Organic food is produced without the use of most 
conventional pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, sewage 
sludge, fertilizer, bioengineering, or ionizing radiation. 


In order for a product to be labeled “organic," a govern¬ 
ment-approved certifier must inspect where the food is 
grown and processed to ensure that USDA organic stan¬ 
dards are adhered to. 


Hydroponic crops are grown in nutrient-enriched 
water rather than soil. Hydroponic growing takes place 
indoors under regulated temperature and light, so any 
growing season may be duplicated. Today, hydroponi- 
cally grown lettuces, spinach, herbs, and tomatoes are 
all readily available. Although they have the advantage 
of being easy to clean, these products may have a less 
pronounced flavor than fruits and vegetables grown in 
the soil. 


AVAILABILITY AND SEASONALITY 


Prior to the increase in agricultural production and dis¬ 
tribution technology, chefs were limited to locally grown 
seasonal fruits and vegetables. Though food establish¬ 
ments are no longer bound to buy local produce, it is still 
a favorable practice if and when possible. It is important 
to support the local growers. Moreover, so-called bou¬ 
tique farmers may have specialty produce (such as wild 
lettuces, golden beets, and yellow tomatoes) that is not 
available through large commercial purveyors. Another 
advantage to buying locally is that the flavor and condi¬ 
tion of the foods are often superior; locally grown sweet 
corn, apricots, peaches, and strawberries that have not 
been shipped are just a few examples. Conversely, there 
are items that ship particularly well. Examples include 
asparagus, head lettuces, broccoli, apples, and citrus 
fruits. 


STORAGE 


Once the produce has been received, following certain 
storage guidelines can ensure that its quality remains 
high. Most foodservice establishments store produce 
for no more than three or four days, although length of 
storage depends on the business's volume, the available 
storage facilities, and delivery frequency. It is ideal to 
let the purveyor handle the produce as long as possible, 
to help ensure that you use the freshest product pos¬ 
sible and not overload your valuable storage space.

TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN 




With a few exceptions (bananas, tomatoes, po¬ 
tatoes, dry onions), ripe fruits and vegetables should 
be refrigerated. Unless otherwise specified, produce 
should be kept at a temperature of 40° to 45°F/4° to 
7°C, with a relative humidity of 80 to 90 percent. The 
ideal situation is to have a separate walk-in or reach-in 
refrigerator for fruits and vegetables. 


Most fruits and vegetables should be kept dry, be¬ 
cause excess moisture can promote spoilage. Therefore, 
most produce should not be peeled, washed, or trimmed 
until just before use. The outer leaves of lettuce, for 
example, should be left intact; carrots should remain 
unpeeled. The exceptions to this rule are the leafy tops 
on root vegetables such as beets, turnips, carrots, and 
radishes. They should be removed and either discarded 
or used immediately, because even after harvesting, 
the leaves absorb nutrients from the root and increase 
moisture loss. 


Fruits and vegetables that need further ripening, 
notably peaches and avocados, should be stored at 
room temperature, 65° to 70°F/18° to 21°C. Once the 
produce is ripe, it should be refrigerated so that it does 
not become overripe. 


fruits 


Fruits are the ovaries that surround or contain the seeds 
of plants. Customarily used in sweet dishes, fruits are 
also excellent with savory items, such as potato latkes 


vegetables 


Vegetables are the roots, tubers, stems, leaves, leaf 
stalks, seeds, seedpods, and flower heads of plants that 
may be safely eaten. Vegetables commonly include a 
number of foods that are botanically classified as fruits, 


herbs 


Herbs are the leaves of aromatic plants, used primarily 
to add flavor to foods. Aroma is a good indicator of qual¬ 
ity in both fresh and dried herbs. They should have even 
color, healthy-looking leaves and stems, and no wilting, 
brown spots, sunburn, or pest damage. 


Fresh herbs should be minced or cut in chiffonade 
as close to service time as possible. They are usually 
added to a dish toward the end of the cooking time. For 




Certain fruits, including apples, bananas, and mel¬ 
ons, emit high amounts of ethylene gas as they sit in 
storage. Ethylene gas can accelerate ripening in unripe 
fruits, but can also promote spoilage in fruits and vege¬ 
tables that are already ripe. For this reason, unless they 
are being used deliberately as a ripening agent, high 
ethylene-producing fruits should be stored separately. 
When separate storage space is unavailable, place 
ethylene-producing fruits in sealed containers. 


Some fruits and vegetables, including onions, garlic, 
lemons, and melons, give off odors that can permeate 
other foods. Dairy products are particularly suscep¬ 
tible to odor absorption and should always be stored 
away from fruits and vegetables. Certain fruits, such as 
apples and cherries, also absorb odors. They too should 
be well wrapped or stored separately. 


Many fruits and vegetables begin to deteriorate af¬ 
ter three or four days. Although citrus fruits, most root 
vegetables, and hard squashes have a longer storage 
life, most restaurants do not hold even these items for 
more than two to three weeks. 




and grilled pork chops. Fruit is wonderful served alone as 
a refreshing breakfast or the finale to a meal. Dried fruits 
find their way into compotes, stuffings, and sauces. 




such as tomatoes. Their culinary application is the guid¬ 
ing principle for placing them in this section rather than 
the previous one. 




uncooked preparations, fresh herbs should be added 
well in advance of serving. 


In general, herbs should be stored loosely wrapped 
in damp paper towels and refrigerated. If desired, place 
the wrapped herbs in plastic bags to help retain mois¬ 
ture and reduce wilting and discoloration of leaves. It is 
a good idea to label the herbs, so they are easy to locate.

apples Apples are perhaps Americas favorite fruit. 
According to surveys from the International Apple Insti¬ 
tute, apples account for nearly 14 percent of all tree fruits 
sold in this country. Apples range in color from yellow to 
green to red, and colors in between. Different varieties 
of apples have particular characteristics. Some are best 
eaten out of hand, others are considered best for pies 
and baking, and still others are selected for their ability 
to cook down into a rich, smooth puree for applesauce. 
For cider, a blend of apples is usually chosen, to give the 
finished drink a full, well-balanced flavor. 


Select firm apples that have a smooth skin with no 
bruising, though rough brown spots are acceptable. 




Apples can be held in climate-controlled cold storage 
for many months without significant loss of quality. 
Dried apples, prepared applesauce, apple juice (bottled 
or frozen concentrate), cider, spiced or plain pie fill¬ 
ings, and a host of other prepared items made from 
apples can also be purchased. 


The flesh of many apples will begin to turn brown 
once they are cut open and come in contact with air. 
Dousing them in acidulated water (water with a little 
lemon juice) will help prevent browning but may not be 
desirable if a pure apple taste is important. The follow¬ 
ing table covers a selection of apple varieties.

berries Berries tend to be highly perishable (with 
the exception of cranberries) and are susceptible to 
bruising, molding, and overripening in fairly short 
order. Inspect all berries and their packaging carefully 
before you accept them. Juice-stained cartons or juice 
leaking through the carton is a clear indication that the 
fruit has been mishandled or is old. Once berries begin 
to turn moldy, the entire batch goes bad quickly. 




When fresh berries are out of season, IQF (individu¬ 
ally quick frozen) berries are often a perfectly fine sub¬ 
stitute. Dried berries are a delicious addition to winter 
fruit compotes, stuffings, or baked goods. The following

citrus fruits Citrus fruits are characterized by 
extremely juicy, segmented flesh, and skins that contain 
aromatic oils. Grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges 
are the most common citrus fruits. They range dramati¬ 
cally in size, color, and flavor. 


Select citrus that is firm and heavy in relation to 
its size, with no soft spots. Green hues or rough brown 
spots generally do not affect the flavor or texture of the 
fruit. For oranges, it is not necessary to select fruits 




with brightly colored skins, as they are often dyed. 
When selecting grapefruits, lemons, and limes, on the 
other hand, look for brightly colored fruits with a finely 
textured skin. Citrus can be stored at room temperature 
for a short time, but should be refrigerated if being held 
for an extended period. Citrus juice is available canned, 
bottled, frozen, and as frozen concentrate. The table 
that follows covers a selection of citrus varieties.

grapes Technically, grapes are berries, but because 
they include so many varieties and have so many differ¬ 
ent uses, they are usually grouped separately. There are 
varieties of grapes, both with seeds and seedless, avail¬ 
able for both eating and wine making. 


Grapes vary greatly in color from pale green to deep 
purple. Choose grapes that are plump and juicy, with 
smooth skins that have a pale gray film (known as bloom). 
Grapes should be firmly attached to their green stems. 
There are varieties of grapes with skin that easily slips off 
the fruit (Concord), and other varieties in which the skin 
remains firmly intact (Thompson seedless). Grapes are 
also dried to make raisins and currants. 




Store grapes, unwashed, in the refrigerator. Grapes 
should be thoroughly washed and blotted dry just prior 
to being eaten. Grapes are best served at room tempera¬ 
ture. The following table covers a selection of grape 
varieties. 


Grapes from California will come into season in late 
May for some red grapes, and June or July for Thomp¬ 
son, and last into early December. Grapes in the eastern 
United States have a shorter season, becoming available 
in August and then gone by November. Imported grapes 
are generally available year-round; almost all imported 
grapes come from Mexico and Chile.

melons These succulent, fragrant fruits are 
members of the gourd family, as are squashes and cu¬ 
cumbers. They come in many varieties and range from 
the size of an orange to that of a watermelon. The two 
major categories of melons are the muskmelon and the 
watermelon. 


There are two kinds of muskmelons commonly 
available, the cantaloupe type and the honeydew type. 


Selecting melons and determining ripeness depends 
greatly on the type. When selecting the cantaloupe- 
type muskmelons, look for heavy fruits with a “full 
slip”—that is, a clean break from the stem—signifying 




that the melon ripened on the vine. When ripe, all 
muskmelons should become slightly soft at the stem 
end and give off a sweet scent. Muskmelons must be 
seeded before they are eaten. 


The mildly flavored watermelon varieties should be 
symmetrical. Avoid those with flat sides, soft spots, or 
damaged rinds. A ripe watermelon should have good 
ground color, without any white on the underside. Un¬ 
ripe melons should be stored in a cool, dark place; ripe 
or cut melon should be kept under refrigeration. The 
following table covers a selection of melon varieties.

melons 






























pears This fruit comes in many varieties, ranging 
from round to bell shaped, spicy to sweet, and yellow to 
red. Unlike many other fruits, pears ripen after they are 
picked. When pears are not fully ripened, they can have 
granules in the flesh known as stone cells, which give 
them an unpleasant sandy or gritty texture. This is a 
positive characteristic because ripe pears are extremely 
fragile and otherwise would not ship well. When choos¬ 
ing pears, look for fruit that is mature and aromatic, 




with no scuffing, bruises, pits, or shriveling in the skin 
or neck. Keep unripe pears at room temperature, but 
refrigerate them once they are ripe because the colder 
temperatures will inhibit the ripening process. Like 
apples, cut pears turn brown once they are exposed 
to the air. Storing them in acidulated water will help 
prevent browning, but may alter the true flavor of the 
pear. The best uses for several varieties are given in the 
following table.

stone fruits Peaches, nectarines, apricots, 
plums, and cherries are often referred to as stone fruits 
because they have one large central pit (stone). These 
fruits are usually divided into either “freestone” or 
“clingstone” varieties. In a freestone fruit, as their name 
suggests, the seed, or stone, more easily separates itself 
from the flesh, whereas the clingstone pit more tightly 
adheres to the flesh of the fruit. Because of their ease of 
use, freestone varieties are more frequently utilized for 
cooking purposes that require the removal of the stone. 
In addition to their fresh form, these fruits are also 
commonly available canned, frozen, and dried. Many 
countries produce fruit brandies, wines, and cordials 
flavored with peaches, cherries, and plums. 




Stone fruits are generally only available in the 
summer months, except for some imports from South 
America. They will soften once picked but not gain any 
sweetness. Therefore, the fruit generally found in the 
marketplace will have been picked while still very firm 
or hard to facilitate shipping without incurring damage 
to the soft, fully ripened fruit. Color is the best indica¬ 
tor of a fruit that is fully matured before picking; look 
for full and vibrantly colored fruit with no hint of green, 
There should also be a full, sweet aroma indicative of 
the flavor when the fruit is softened. The following 
table covers a selection of stone fruit varieties.

soft-shell squash, cucumber, 


and eggplant Soft-shell squash, cucumber, 
and eggplant are all vegetables that are picked when 
they are immature to ensure a delicate flesh, tender 
seeds, and thin skins. Soft-shell squash and eggplant 




varieties cook rather quickly, while cucumbers are most 
often eaten raw. Select soft-shell squashes, eggplants, 
and cucumbers that are on the smaller side, firm, 
brightly colored, and without bruising. These varieties 
should all be refrigerated.

lettuce Each of the thousands of lettuce varieties 
can be classified into one of the following categories: 
butterhead, crisphead, romaine, or leaf. Select lettuce 
that is crisp, never wilted or bruised. Lettuce should not 
be washed, cut, or torn until just before service. Store 
lettuce in the refrigerator, covered loosely with damp 
paper towels. 




As with most greens, it is very important to thor¬ 
oughly wash lettuce, as dirt and grit tend to hide between 
the leaves. Never submerge lettuce in water for an 
extended amount of time, and be sure that it is dried 
well after washing (a salad spinner is great for this).

CHEF'S NOTES ON COOKING GREENS 




Cooking greens are also known as pot¬ 
herbs. These vegetables are high in fiber, 
iron, calcium, and photochemicals, such 
as vitamins C and A, and folic acid. They 
are considered a “superfood,” indicating 
that they are one of the most naturally 
nutrient-rich foods. Most cooking greens 
are considered cool season vegetables, 
making them a good choice for gardens in 
areas with shorter growing seasons. These 




greens can also be eaten at any stage of 
development. If they are tender and young, 
they may be cooked briefly or eaten raw. 
Always look for cool and moist greens 
with a rich green color and no signs of 
dryness, yellowing, or wilted edges. Store 
any green vegetables in a perforated plastic 
bag, or wrapped in a cotton towel in the 
refrigerator.

mushrooms Mushrooms are a fungus that ex¬ 
ists in thousands of varieties. Cultivated mushrooms, 
commonly available today, include the familiar white 
mushroom and varieties such as portobello, cremini, 
shiitake, and oyster mushrooms. Wild mushrooms, 
prized for their concentrated, earthy flavor, include 
the cepe (porcini), chanterelle, morel, and the truffle. 
Knowing your purveyor is important when you have 
wild mushrooms on the menu, as many varieties are 
poisonous. Some varieties of mushrooms are available 
canned, frozen, and dried. 


Select mushrooms that are firm, without blemishes 
or breaks. If using varieties such as the white or crem¬ 
ini, the caps should be tightly closed, as opened gills are 




a sign of age. Conversely, when selecting portobellos—a 
mature cremini—it is desirable for the gills to be open, 
signifying a concentration of flavor. Mushrooms that 
are to be cooked whole should be of equal size so that 
they cook evenly. 


Mushrooms should be stored in the refrigerator, in 
a single layer, covered with damp paper towels. When 
you want to use them, wipe mushrooms with a damp 
paper towel, or very quickly rinse them in cold water 
and drain immediately. Mushrooms should never be 
submerged in water, since they absorb it like a sponge 
and will become mushy. See the following table for in¬ 
formation on varieties of mushrooms.

onion family Onions, invaluable to any kitch¬ 
en, belong to the lily family. They fall into two main 
categories, reflecting the state in which they are used: 
dry (cured) and green (fresh). Green onions include scal¬ 
lions, leeks, and ramps. Dry onions are categorized by 
size and color. They can range in size from pearl to Span¬ 
ish, and from white to yellow to red in color. 


Garlic, shallots, and onions (green and dry) all share a 
pungent flavor and aroma. Dry onions make up half 
of the most fundamental aromatic combination, mirepoix. 
Green onions, whether cooked (leeks) or raw (scallions), 
impart a sweetly subtle onion flavor. Shallots and garlic are 
the flavoring agents in innumerable preparations. 




Select dry onions, garlic, and shallots that are heavy 
for their size and have tight-fitting, dry, papery skins. 
Green onions should be green with white bottoms. They 
should be crisp, not wilted. Dry onions, shallots, and 
garlic should be stored in a relatively cool, dry area of the 
kitchen in the bags or boxes in which they are received. 
Green onions should be refrigerated and must be thor¬ 
oughly washed before they are used (leeks tend to have 
dirt between each layer). 


Chives are also a member of the onion family, though 
their main culinary application is similar to that of fresh 
herbs. See the following table for more information on 
onions.

peppers There are two basic types of peppers: 
sweet peppers and chiles. Sweet peppers are sometimes 
called bell peppers because of their shape. Sweet pep¬ 
pers of various colors have similar flavors, though red 
and yellow varieties tend to be sweeter. 


Chiles, an important ingredient in many cuisines, 
are available in various sizes, colors, and levels of heat. 
Capsaicin is the compound that gives a chile its heat, 
and it is most potent in the white ribs inside the pepper. 
Generally, the hotter chiles are smaller in size. It is 




imperative to take precautions when handling chiles; 
wear gloves, wash cutting surfaces and knives, and 
avoid contact with sensitive tissue such as the eyes. 


Chiles are available fresh, canned, dried (whole, 
flaked, and ground), and smoked. Frequently, dried and/or 
smoked chiles are given a name different than their fresh 
counterpart (e.g., smoked jalapenos are called chipotles). 


When selecting both categories, look for firm, heavy 
peppers, with tight, glossy skin, without puckering or 
wrinkling. The flesh should be relatively thick and crisp.

tubers and rhizomes Tubers and rhi¬ 
zomes, which include a variety of miscellaneous vegeta¬ 
bles such as the Jerusalem artichoke and jicama as well as 
the entire family of potatoes, are vegetables that are con¬ 
nected to the root system by an underground stem and 
are not, therefore, connected directly to the plant, as are 
roots. Tubers act to store nutrients and moisture for the 
plant’s reproductive capability. 


Select tubers and rhizomes that are firm and the ap¬ 
propriate size and shape to their type. To retain quality, 
tubers should be stored dry and unpeeled, away from 
excess heat and light, in a well-ventilated area. When 
exposed to moisture or heat, tubers begin to sprout and 
wrinkle. 




The tuberous potato includes sweet potatoes/yams 
for culinary purposes (though of another botanical clas¬ 
sification). Though potatoes are remarkably versatile in 
their cooking media, there are types that work best for 
each cooking method. Potatoes are separated into cate¬ 
gories based on starch content, and subsequently divid¬ 
ed according to size (A, B, C) and skin color (white, red, 
yellow, purple). Size A potatoes range from i 7 s to 2 Va 
inches; size B range from 1V2 to 2V4 inches; and size C 
must be less than 1V4 inches. New potatoes are those of 
any color that are recently harvested and thin-skinned. 
Most size C potatoes are marketed as creamer potatoes.

tomatoes This universal vegetable is actually a 
fruit. It is grown in hundreds of varieties, in colors from 
green to yellow to bright red to purple. Basic types in¬ 
clude small, round cherry tomatoes; oblong plum toma¬ 
toes; and large standard tomatoes. All are available in 
various colors. All have smooth, shiny skin, juicy flesh, 
and small, edible seeds. Most tomatoes grown commer¬ 
cially are picked unripe and allowed to ripen in transit, 
though many chefs prefer to find locally grown varieties 
that are ripened on the vine. There has been a recent 
surge in demand for the heirloom species, such as the 
Cherokee Purple and Green Zebra. 




Select brightly colored tomatoes, free of soft spots 
and blemishes. They should be heavy for their size, but 
not overly firm. Tomatoes should not be refrigerated 
because the cold makes the texture mushy, seizes the 
flavor, and halts ripening. 


Tomatoes may be purchased in numerous forms, 
including sun-dried and canned puree, paste, and diced. 
The following table covers several varieties of tomatoes, 
including their relative, the tomatillo.
