meat 




identification 




For most restaurants, the purchase, preparation, and service of meats is one of 
the most expensive areas of the business—but also one of the most potentially 
profitable. In order to get the most value out of the meats purchased, it is importan 
to understand how to select the right cut for a particular cooking method. 






























meat basics 




The meat, poultry, and game cuts that a restaurant 
should buy will depend upon the nature of the particular 
operation. A restaurant featuring predominantly a la 
minute preparations—especially one with a preponder¬ 
ance of grilled or sauteed items—will need to purchase 
extremely tender (and more expensive) cuts. A restau¬ 
rant that uses a variety of techniques may be able to use 
some less-tender cuts—for example, the veal shank in a 
braise such as osso buco. 


Meats can be purchased in a number of forms and at 
varying degrees of readiness to cook. The chef should 
consider several factors when deciding what type of 
meat to buy. Storage capacity, the equipment required 
to prepare a menu item, the kitchen staffs ability to 
fabricate cuts, and the volume of meat required must 
all be taken into consideration. Once this information 
is evaluated, the chef can determine whether it is more 
economical to purchase large pieces, such as whole legs 
of veal, or prefabricated meats, such as veal already cut 
into a top round, or precut scaloppini. 


Meats should be checked for wholesomeness and 
freshness. Cut surfaces should appear moist, but not 
shiny. The meat should have a good color, which varies 
by type as well as by cut. The meat should also smell ap¬ 
pealing. Packaged meats should arrive with the packag¬ 
ing intact with no punctures or tears. 


The tables accompanying the following sections 
contain key pieces of information about beef, veal, pork, 
and lamb, adapted from The Meat Buyer's Guide by the 
North American Meat Processors Association (NAMP), 
including item numbers as assigned by the NAMP and 
an average range in size for a cut. Appropriate cooking 
methods for various cuts have also been included. 


STORAGE 


Meats, poultry, and game should be wrapped and stored 
under refrigeration. When possible, they should be held 
in a separate unit, or at least in a separate part of the 
cooler. They should always be placed on trays to prevent 
them from dripping onto other foods or the floor. 


The chef should separate different kinds of meats; 
for example, poultry should not come into contact 
with beef, or pork products into contact with any other 
meats. This will prevent cross contamination. 




Vacuum-packed meats can be stored directly in the 
package, as long as it has not been punctured or ripped. 
Once unwrapped, meats should be rewrapped in air-per¬ 
meable paper, such as butcher's paper, because airtight 
containers promote bacterial growth that could result in 
spoilage or contamination. 


Variety meats, poultry, and uncured pork products, 
which have short shelf lives, should be cooked as soon 
as possible after they are received. Meat stored at the 
proper temperature and under optimal conditions can 
be held for several days without noticeable loss of qual¬ 
ity. Meat can also be frozen for longer storage. 


» REFRIGERATED: 28° TO 32°F/-2° TO 0°C 


» FROZEN: 0° TO 20°F/-18° TO -7°C 


INSPECTION AND GRADING 


Government inspection of all meats is mandatory. 
Inspections are required at various times: at the slaugh¬ 
terhouse (antemortem) and again after butchering 
(postmortem). This is done to ensure that the animal is 
free from disease and that the meat is wholesome and 
fit for human consumption. Inspection is a service paid 
for by tax dollars. 


Some states have relinquished the responsibility for 
inspecting meats to federal inspectors. Those states 
that still administer their own inspections of meat 
must at least meet, if not exceed, the accepted federal 
standards. 


Quality grading, however, is not mandatory. The 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed 
specific standards to assign grades to meats and trains 
graders. The packer may, however, choose not to hire a 
USDA grader and may forgo grading in favor of the use 
of an in-house brand name instead. The costs involved 
in grading meats are absorbed by the individual meat 
packer, not the taxpayer, since this process is voluntary. 


Depending upon the particular animal, the grader will 
consider overall carcass shape, ratio of fat to lean, ratio 
of meat to bone, color, and marbling of lean flesh. The 
grade placed on a particular carcass is then applied to all 
the cuts from that animal. In beef, only a small percentage 
of meats produced is graded prime. Choice and select 
are more often available. Grades lower than select are 




70 




TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN 




generally used for processed meat and are of no practical 
importance to the restaurant (or retail) industry. 


Some meats may also receive yield grades. This 
grade is of the greatest significance to wholesalers. It 
indicates the amount of salable meat in relation to the 
total weight of the carcass. Butchers refer to this as 
"cutability" In other words, it is a measure of the yield of 
edible meat from each pound of the carcass. 


MARKET FORMS OF MEAT 


After slaughtering, inspection, and grading, the animal 
carcass is cut into manageable pieces. Sides are pre¬ 
pared by making a cut down the length of the backbone. 
Each side is cut into two pieces to make quarters, divid¬ 
ing the sides between specific vertebrae. Saddles are 
made by cutting the animal across the belly, again at a 
specified point. The exact standards for individual ani¬ 
mal types govern where the carcass is to be divided. 


The next step is to cut the animal into what are re¬ 
ferred to as primal cuts. There are uniform standards for 
beef, veal, pork, and lamb primals. These large cuts are 
then further broken down into subprimals. Subprimals 
are generally trimmed and packed as foodservice, value 
added, or HRI (Hotel, Restaurant, and Institution) cuts. 
There may be even more fabrication or butchering done 
in order to prepare steaks, chops, roasts, or ground 
meat. These cuts are referred to as portion control cuts. 


The amount of butchering done in packing plants 
has increased over the past several years. While it is still 
possible to purchase hanging meat, most operations will 
buy what is referred to as boxed meat. This indicates 
that the meat has been fabricated to a specific point 
(primal, subprimal, or retail cut), packed in Cryovac, 
boxed, and shipped for sale to purveyors, butchers, 
chain retail outlets, and so forth. 


KOSHER MEATS 


Kosher meats are specially slaughtered, bled, and 
fabricated in order to comply with religious dietary 
laws. In this country, only beef and veal forequarters, 




poultry, and some game are customarily used for kosher 
preparations. Kosher meats are butchered from ani¬ 
mals slaughtered by a shohet, or by a specially trained 
rabbi. The animal must be killed with a single stroke of a 
knife, then fully bled. All the veins and arteries must be 
removed from the meat. This process would essentially 
mutilate the flesh of loins and legs of beef and veal; 
therefore, these are generally not sold as kosher. 


OFFAL 


Offal can best be described as the edible by-products 
of a meat carcass. Examples include organ meats such 
as the liver, kidney, heart, brain, tripe, certain glands, 
and intestinal tracts. In addition, the cheeks, tail, and 
tongue are part of the offal category. Offal is generally 
inexpensive but requires some skill to cook properly. 
Organ meats are composed of fibers that are different 
from those of lean muscle. Membranes, blood vessels, 
and connective tissues need to be removed from livers 
and kidneys. Organ meats, such as the liver and kidneys, 
are high in iron, which translates into rich flavor. The tail 
has some meat and a lot of collagen and is typically used 
for rich braises. 


In many cultures, offal is considered a delicacy. 


Some offal is considered the epitome of high cuisine. 


An example would be the fattened duck or goose liver 
known as foie gras. This meat has a consistency that 
resembles butter and a distinctive flavor. Foie gras is 
an exception to the general rule that organ meats are 
inexpensive and can command a high price. Another ex¬ 
ception to this rule is the sweetbread, or thymus gland, 
of veal. When properly prepared, this soft-structured 
gland can be eaten with a fork. Sweetbreads are in high 
demand and warrant a high cost. 


Organ meats tend to be highly perishable and there¬ 
fore must be used fresh, within a week of slaughter, or 
purchased frozen. Be sure to keep frozen items below 
32° and -4°F/0° and -18°C to ensure the formation of 
small ice crystals and minimize damage.

meat basics 




beef Beef is essential to the foodservice industry, 
especially in the United States. A significant source of 
protein, beef is featured in an array of classic and con¬ 
temporary dishes. This expensive product demands spe¬ 
cial care and training. Utilizing as much of each cut to 
maximize the yield is an important practice to follow. 


Cattle used for the beef industry are typically steers 
(castrated males) over one year old and heifers (female 
cows) not required for breeding. The older the bovine, 




the tougher the meat. Specialty beef such as Kobe beef 
from Japan, Limousin beef from France, and Certified 
Angus, natural, organic, and dry-aged beef from the 
United States are also available. 


The eight grades of beef, in order of highest to low¬ 
est quality, are as follows: Prime, Choice, Select, Stan¬ 
dard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter, and Canner. Prime is 
usually reserved for restaurants and butcher shops. 






These cuts are from the primal cut known as the round: 1. hind shank, 2. shank 
stew, 3. top round, 4. top round tied as a roast, 5. marrow bones

veal Veal is the flesh of a young calf, generally four 
to five months old. Because of its young, delicately ten¬ 
der flesh, it is considered by some to be the finest meat 
available. Classical preparations include, but are not 
limited to, osso buco, vitello tonnato, cordon bleu, veal 
piccata, and veal scaloppine. 


Fine veal calves are fed mother’s milk or formula. 
Milk-fed veal is up to twelve weeks old and is believed 
to have the most tender meat. Formula-fed calves 




consume a special diet and are the standard type of veal 
used today; this veal is up to four months old. 


Veal should be selected by color; it should be light 
pink in color and tender. The five USDA grades of veal, 
in order of highest to lowest quality, are Prime, Choice, 
Good, Standard, and Utility. Because the overall ratio of 
meat to bone is less than a full-grown bovine, there are 
proportionately fewer cuts of veal. 






These cuts are from the hindsaddle: 1. bottom round, 2. shank, 3. osso buco, 4. top round cap off, 
5. portion-cut veal cutlets, 6. trimmed loin, 7. portion-cut chops

pork Pork, the meat of domesticated pigs, is among 
the most popular meat sold in the United States. Typi¬ 
cally high in fat, pigs have been specifically bred over 
many generations to produce leaner cuts of meat. Pigs 
are commonly slaughtered under one year of age to en¬ 
sure a tender product. 


Although quality grades are less frequently assigned 
to pork, when applied, the USDA grades, in order of 
highest to lowest quality, are 1, 2, 3, 4, and Utility. 




Because USDA grading is not required for pork and 
federal grading must be paid for, packers will often use 
their own grading system. This does not necessarily 
mean that various cuts of pork are not of good qual¬ 
ity, for the grading systems used by major packers are 
clearly defined and are generally reliable. In the tables 
that follow, BRT indicates boned, rolled, and tied. RTE 
signifies ready to eat.

lamb and mutton Lamb is the tender meat 


produced by young, domesticated sheep. Its texture is a 
direct result of what it consumes and the age at which 
it is slaughtered. The milk-fed varieties of lamb are in¬ 
clined to yield the most delicate meat. Once a lamb be¬ 
gins to eat grass, the flesh loses some of its tenderness. 
However, most lamb produced in the United States 
is finished on a grain diet and is six to seven months 




old. Lamb that is allowed to age over sixteen months is 
known as mutton. Mutton is considered to have a more 
pronounced flavor and texture than lamb. As with other 
varieties of meat, lamb becomes tougher as it ages. 


Lamb tends to be fatty. Its unique flavor pairs nicely 
with intense seasonings and accompaniments. The five 
grades of lamb, in order of highest to lowest quality, are 
Prime, Choice, Good, Utility, and Cull.

venison and furred game Free- 


roaming and domesticated wild animals fall under the 
category of game. A variety of game meats have become 
increasingly popular due in part to customer awareness 
of lower fat and cholesterol content. Depending upon 
the area of the country, several types of furred game are 
available. 


Game meats are categorized into two segments: 
large and small. Venison is the most popular large 
game, characterized by lean meat that is free from 
intramuscular fat, generally dark red in color, and suit¬ 
able for roasting, sauteing, and grilling. Though venison 




commonly refers to deer, other members of the venison 
family include moose, elk, and reindeer. Buffalo and 
wild boar are other popular large game. 


The most common of the small game is rabbit. 
Rabbit has mild, lean, tender, and fine-textured meat. 


A mature rabbit ranges from three to five pounds, and 
young rabbit is generally two to three pounds. The loin 
is often sauteed or roasted, while legs are commonly 
braised or stewed. 


Commercial game meats are federally inspected. 
The quality of the flesh is a direct result of age, diet, and 
the time of year that it was killed. 






These cuts are from a variety of game animals: 1. venison (eg/haunch f 2. boneless venison 
loin, 3. venison medallions, 4. venison saddle, 5. trenched venison rack, 6. venison shoulder, 
7. boneless venison shoulder, 8. rabbit

poultry The word poultry refers to any domesti¬ 
cated bird used for human consumption. Once reserved 
for special occasions, chicken and other poultry have 
become commonplace in restaurants and homes. The 
subtle and familiar flavor of chicken lends itself well 
to a number of different cooking methods. Considered 
very nutritious, poultry entrees are among the most 
popular on most menus. 




Similar to other meats, poultry must undergo a 
mandatory inspection for wholesomeness. The grades 
of USDA A, B, or C depend on numerous factors, such 
as carcass shape and the ratio of meat to bone. Once 
inspected, the birds are plucked, cleaned, chilled, and 
packaged. They may be purchased whole or in parts. 
Poultry is classified by age. The younger the bird, the 
more tender the flesh. 








These birds are examples of geese and ducks: 1. Buddhist duck (called Pekin duck if the head is 
removed), 2. moulard duck breast, 3. goose, 4. moulard duck legs, 5. foie gras
