CALCULATING EDIBLE PORTION COST


recipes often assume ingredients are ready to cook, so when it comes to costing a recipe, the edible portion cost (EPC) per unit can be calculated from the as-purchased cost (APC) per unit, as long as the edible portion is expressed in the same unit of mea¬ sure as the cost unit.


Yield percent
EXAMPLE:
$0.106/oz carrots (APC) 0.75 (Yield % for tourneed carrots)
$0.141/oz tourneed carrots (EPC)
EPQx EPC = Total cost


 4oz tourneed carrots (EPQ) x $0.141/oz toumeed carrots (EPC) = $0,564 per serving (total cost)
